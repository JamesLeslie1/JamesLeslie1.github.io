CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance technique, which argues that chances to upset can be reduced by altering a variety of systems such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being collared, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, reducing benefits from crime commission, and lowering provocations that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the transgressor needs to know the added surveillance for it to accomplish its preferred impact.</p>
