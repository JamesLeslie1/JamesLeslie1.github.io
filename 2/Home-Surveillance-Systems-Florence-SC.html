<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces.

As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "understanding that you are being watched by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You don't wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people may learn to be cautious about the periodicals and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals considered to be "out of time and location" with the environments went through extended surveillance.</p>
