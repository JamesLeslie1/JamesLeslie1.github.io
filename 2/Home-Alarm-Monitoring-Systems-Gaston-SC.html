<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, others, and hotels. Some people may say that we should not have surveillance cameras in public places. They declare that they invade personal privacy. The argument here, nevertheless, is why be out in public if you desire personal privacy? Surveillance cameras are meant to keep you and other home safe, not to stalk you.

Some individuals would rather pay an alarm company the month-to-month monitoring rate instead of purchasing a self-monitored security system. Expertly monitored security systems require a month-to-month monitoring charge that can range from ($ 20 to $60) monthly. When determining how much a burglar alarm costs consumers need to realize that if they add more features, the cost will increase.</p>
