<p>Thanks to recent improvements in technology, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've decided to install a burglar alarm, you need to consider the following advantages of wireless technology. For some, that may be worth the $300 cost. However while we like the smart functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Cam IQ, much of the cameras we looked at offer the exact same perks at a more affordable cost.
