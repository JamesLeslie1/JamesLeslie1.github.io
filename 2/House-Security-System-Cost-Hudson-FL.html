It receives an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership prepare for additional cloud storage.

The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
