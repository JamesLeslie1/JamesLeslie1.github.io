<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
