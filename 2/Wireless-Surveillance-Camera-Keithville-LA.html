<p>Prices - ADT uses three separate packages, which vary in terms of options offered. The basic home security package is $28.99 each month. Home automation and control costs around $36.99 and video services can be found in at $52.99. Installation and other costs might use. Contractually, this is a 3-year contract with a six-month trial.

<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search innovation that is quickly changing the security industry, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so essential?  For starters, Deep Knowing allows somebody to discover what they are searching for without having to search through hours of useless video footage.  Think of a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the aspects you are trying to find in the recorded video footage.  For example, if we require to see all video from today that has a police vehicle in it, we merely type police" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police cruiser appears.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic.
