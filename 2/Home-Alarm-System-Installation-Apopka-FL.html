What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a should for use when you're away from home, however you should not need to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming.
