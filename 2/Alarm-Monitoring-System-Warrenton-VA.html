<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor.

Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
