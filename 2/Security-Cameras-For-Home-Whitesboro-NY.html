<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the entire community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to save and for how long you prepare to keep recorded video. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video once you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
