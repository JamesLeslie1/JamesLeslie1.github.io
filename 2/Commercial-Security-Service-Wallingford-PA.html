Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is also costly if you do not commit to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>This clever clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device.

We love that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your property, which can get pricey.
