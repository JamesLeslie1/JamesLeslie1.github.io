Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, consisting of creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.

<p>In The Sims, an alarm system will cover an entire room when placed indoors. It will cover a 5-tile radius if placed on an outside wall.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
