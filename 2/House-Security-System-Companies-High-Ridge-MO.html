<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
