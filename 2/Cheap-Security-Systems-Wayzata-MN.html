<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
