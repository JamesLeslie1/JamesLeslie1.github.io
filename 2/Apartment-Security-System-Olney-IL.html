According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day.

<p>Alarm monitoring becomes part of a complete home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (often very high decibel so that you can hear it as can neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company. The control panel communicates with the other parts of the system, including the cameras, window and door sensors, and motion sensors, to detect an intruder or something that is wrong.
