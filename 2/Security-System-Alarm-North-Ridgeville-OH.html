<p>so say you have a camera that somebody can see it they would shoot it if they had a gun so I advise to have cameras built in to a house that will be pertected by cameras.

<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
