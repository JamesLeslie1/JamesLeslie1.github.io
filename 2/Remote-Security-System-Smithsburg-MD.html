Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
