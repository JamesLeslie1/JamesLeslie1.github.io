<p>The NVR removes these issues, since it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR.
