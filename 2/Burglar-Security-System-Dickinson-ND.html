Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You don't want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "people may learn to be cautious about the books and periodicals they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers.
