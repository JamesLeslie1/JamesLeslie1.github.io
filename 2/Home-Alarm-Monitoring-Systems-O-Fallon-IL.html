<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings.

With standard clever home devices like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and check that you locked your doors.

Consumer-grade cameras can work well in certain circumstances such as nanny web cams or checking in on a pet, though when wanting to collect evidence of a criminal offense they frequently lose.</p>
