It receives an Exceptional score for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.
