Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, extra sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you do not commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to utilize as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though.
