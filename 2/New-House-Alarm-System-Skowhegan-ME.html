<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you require extra cable televisions. DVR systems are challenging to scale up due to the fact that once every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to purchase an entirely new DVR prior to including another camera to the system. DVRs also need that the connected cameras remain in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to break down.</p>

This one changes and has a motion-sensor on a light and siren which might be a good deterrent to burglars, plus it's clearly waterproof and has a longer cable. Otherwise, same concept, same app, still just as easy. to setup. And you don't require to fret about its battery life. Normally, the battery might last for 4 to 6 months per charge.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
