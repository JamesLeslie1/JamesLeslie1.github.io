<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be useful for installation. Since it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Sadly I purchased 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Kid was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is truly fantastic. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
