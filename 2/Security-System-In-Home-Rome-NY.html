<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for false alarms, and minimize the number of unnecessary cops and fire actions. Alarm monitoring companies are the experts and should be teaching their consumers how to appropriately care and set for their alarm. National and local data have actually shown that raising fines paid directly by property owners and companies have actually had no considerable influence on lowering the variety of false alarms. Alarm-monitoring companies have enjoyed the benefit of authorities action to their consumers' alarms without any accountability for the precision or reliability of those alarms.</p>

<h3>Outdoor Security Systems Rome NY 13440</h3>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
