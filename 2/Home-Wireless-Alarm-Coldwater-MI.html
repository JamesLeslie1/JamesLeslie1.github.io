<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
