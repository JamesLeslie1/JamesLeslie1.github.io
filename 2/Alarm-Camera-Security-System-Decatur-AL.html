<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF compliant, which means you can utilize a number of various third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera work with other ONVIF-compliant gadgets. We believe burglar alarms work best when integrated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and gain access to control. That way when a door is opened, or a camera is passed by, you will be alerted.
