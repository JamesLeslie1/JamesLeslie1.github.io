<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
