Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".
