<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower criminal offense. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.
