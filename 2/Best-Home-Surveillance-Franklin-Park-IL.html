<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
