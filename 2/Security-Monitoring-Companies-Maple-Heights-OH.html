The first guard got here early so he could look at the whole location and speak with me about my concerns. He was professional, really reassuring and polite. The second guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I got here in the morning to get the event started, he was also expert, encouraging and polite. We were extremely delighted with your service and I will recommend that we call on your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep.
