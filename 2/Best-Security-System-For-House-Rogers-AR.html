<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent.

<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a should for use when you're far from home, but you should not need to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it easy to arm and disarm the system. If you currently own a Ring video doorbell and wish to expand your home security protection, adding Ring Alarm makes sense. When you include other Ring items to Ring Alarm it becomes a more robust security system that can deliver live video streaming, two-way communication, and smart lighting. Of course, at that point, the cheap price tag becomes more costly.</p>
<p>And it doesn't cost that much more to trick out your system with doorbell cameras, floodlights, and outdoor security cameras.

So is the plan for recordings from several cameras: $10 a month or $100 a year.</p>
