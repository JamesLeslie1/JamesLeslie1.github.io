Still, what you get for the cash is all the normal Arlo traits in terms of the solid develop quality, outstanding camera video footage, lots of smart functions and a polished app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
