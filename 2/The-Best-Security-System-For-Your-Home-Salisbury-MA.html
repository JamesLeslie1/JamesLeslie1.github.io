<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based on two unshielded (or 'dripping') coax cables buried around 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter emits continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is gotten by the other cable. When the change in field strength damages due to the existence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is created. The system is hidden after installation. Care needs to be required to ensure the surrounding soil provides good drain in order to prevent problem alarms.</p>
