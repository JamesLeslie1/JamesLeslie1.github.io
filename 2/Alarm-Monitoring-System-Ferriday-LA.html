<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of totally free storage, and utilize 2 AA batteries that can last approximately two years. However, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not give you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.

Your alarm company should be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm charges, and offer physical evidence like camera video or a damaged window to call for cops response.</p>
