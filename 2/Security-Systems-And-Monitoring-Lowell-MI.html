In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further electrical wiring.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
