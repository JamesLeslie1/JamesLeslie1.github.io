In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually via 110VAC power.</p>
