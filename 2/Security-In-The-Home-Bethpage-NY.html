<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor.

Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
