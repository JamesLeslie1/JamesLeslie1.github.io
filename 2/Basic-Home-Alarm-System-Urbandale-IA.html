The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, therefore we may revisit this evaluation. Essentially, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video to the cloud. The broad face of the camera provides you an outstanding visual field, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll utilize to wait to the cloud.)
