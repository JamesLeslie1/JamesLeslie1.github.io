The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, therefore we may revisit this evaluation.
