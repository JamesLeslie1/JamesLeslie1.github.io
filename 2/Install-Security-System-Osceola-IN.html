<p>We downloaded each camera's app to an iPhone 7, an iPad, and a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie, when possible. The cameras invested weeks protecting our front door, notifying us to pals, family members, delivery individuals, and even the milkman. When we got a good enough look at those friendly faces, we slanted the entire collection outside for another two weeks to see what sort of outcomes we would get when the cameras faced the house across the street, which is roughly 50 feet away.</p>
