<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
