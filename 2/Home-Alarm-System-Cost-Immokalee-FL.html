<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF compliant, which means you can use numerous different third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera deal with other ONVIF-compliant devices. We believe burglar alarms work best when integrated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and gain access to control. That method when a door is opened, or a camera is passed by, you will look out.
