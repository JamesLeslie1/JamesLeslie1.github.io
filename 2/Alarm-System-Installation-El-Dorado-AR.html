<p>If you utilize Alexa to manage the clever lights in your home, then you must think about experimenting with Alexa Guard, a fairly new home security mode with a couple of cool techniques.

However Cove just has one camera option and it's not the very best.

However, you might select to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if requested by the client.</p>
