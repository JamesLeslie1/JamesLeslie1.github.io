<p>Because it's more complicated than it must be, we don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

These types of cameras normally use rechargeable batteries that can be quickly popped out and taken indoors for charging with a USB cable television, however they tend to drain pipes rapidly in cooler weather.
