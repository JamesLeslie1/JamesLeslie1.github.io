<p>Discover how to create, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and minimize criminal offense. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with terrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.
