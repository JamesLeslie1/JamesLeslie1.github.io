<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, theft, and vandalism. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should once again respond to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating costly incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically shut off the heater. You can automatically make the clever lights turn on to frighten away potential robbers if the motion sensors are set off.</p>
