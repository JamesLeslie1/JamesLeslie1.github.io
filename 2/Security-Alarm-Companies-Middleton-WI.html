Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to keep and how long you plan to keep recorded video. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to eat up storage area rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video once you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
