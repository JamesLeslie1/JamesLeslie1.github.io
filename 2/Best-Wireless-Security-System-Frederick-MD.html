<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
