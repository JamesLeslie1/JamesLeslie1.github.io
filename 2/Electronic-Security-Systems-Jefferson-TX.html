<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
