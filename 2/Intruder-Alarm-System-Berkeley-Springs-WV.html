<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies whenever you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
