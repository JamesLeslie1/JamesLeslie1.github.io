<p>This clever clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During screening, we found it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly activating when movement was spotted. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.

The price of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you commit to a three-year agreement. Ring's Protect Plus strategy chooses $10 per month and doesn't require a contract.</p>
