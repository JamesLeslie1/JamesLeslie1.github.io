<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the maker's statistics because this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant culprit for short battery life by far.

The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with information after the fact, which indicates that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and use up a lot of taping storage space. So much, in truth, that they require about 4 times the hard drive area of 1080p to tape the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to spend more money.</p>

For example, you can have a wise plug turn on a light inside your home or activate an external siren when the camera spots motion.</p>
