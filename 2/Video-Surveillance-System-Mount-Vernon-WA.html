<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
