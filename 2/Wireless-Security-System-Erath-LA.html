Hard disk drive storage is safe, secure, and hassle-free, with numerous systems using growth and totally free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
