<p>The NVR removes these problems, since it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

We've experienced a couple of technical concerns while long-term testing the Abode Iota, therefore will continue to test and update accordingly. We no longer recommend it.</p>
