<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

<p>While not an important requirement for a home security system, all top companies offer a variety of camera choices as add-ons. Property owners can select from outdoor or indoor security cameras that can record footage when an alarm is triggered, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, baby-sitter cameras, and more. All of these cameras can be integrated into the total system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. To comprehend how home wireless security systems work, some basic understanding of alarm systems is useful.

<p>When a CCTV camera areas something of interest, a recorder ensures you can go back and view it later.

<p>Vivint shines through its exclusive equipment, which stands apart in its sleekness and performance compared to that of its competitors. The system's operating hub is the Sky Control, a 7-inch color touchscreen gadget from which you trigger and deactivate your system, lock and unlock doors, view video feeds, adjust wise home devices, and far more.

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for more wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera separately, generally through 110VAC power.</p>

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensing units, are various in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most extreme frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
