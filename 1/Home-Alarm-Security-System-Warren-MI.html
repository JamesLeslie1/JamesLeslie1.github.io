<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>For clever home features, we recommend the ADT Pulse package.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
