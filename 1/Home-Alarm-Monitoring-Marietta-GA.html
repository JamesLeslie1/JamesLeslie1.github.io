<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers fund authorities action to alarmed properties) a pricey and inefficient  approach to robbery decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
