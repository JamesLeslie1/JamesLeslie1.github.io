<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our screening-- during the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on offered bandwidth, which might change throughout the day.

Gadgets that feature the SimpliSafe system consist of the SimpliCam, an indoor camera with a motion sensor and HD video quality, and a keychain remote used to arm or disarm the system.

However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
