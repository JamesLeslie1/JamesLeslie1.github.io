<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
