<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your email address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're trying to connect to.

<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
