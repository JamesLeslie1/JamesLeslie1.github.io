Once any alarm system integrated into the PCU was activated, the nearest camera to that location would be shown on that specific monitor.

An unmonitored system leaves all the work up to you. That means you need to be on day, call and night, during work and vacation time, and all set to figure out whether police, fire departments, or other emergency situation services require to be dispatched. Then, you need to make that call yourself. It's a huge difference, and an expertly monitored system is essentially more secure than an unmonitored or self-monitored  one.</p>
