<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
