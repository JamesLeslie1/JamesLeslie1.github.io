It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not recommend that for home security due to the fact that if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
