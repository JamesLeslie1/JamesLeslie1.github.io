It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.
