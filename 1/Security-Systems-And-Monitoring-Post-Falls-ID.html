<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>Worth keeping in mind: you can likewise get an outdoor version (₤ 199.99, Amazon) which is basically the exact same but with a variety added functions. This one has a motion-sensor and changes on a light and siren which may be a good deterrent to trespassers, plus it's clearly waterproof and has a longer cable.
