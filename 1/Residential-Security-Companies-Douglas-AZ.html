<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
