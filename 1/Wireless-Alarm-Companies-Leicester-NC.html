We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for among our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home devices like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and examine that you locked your doors.

There are a handful of companies that use free video storage, but the video is sent out to a cloud account and only kept for a couple of days. For longer access to video, expect to pay a regular monthly storage fee.</p>

It's also worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
