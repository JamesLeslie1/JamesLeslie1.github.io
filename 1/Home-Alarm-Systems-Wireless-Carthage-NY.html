Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, including creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
