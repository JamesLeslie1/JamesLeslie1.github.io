<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
