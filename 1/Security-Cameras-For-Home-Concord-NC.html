The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building.

Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you stroll by.
