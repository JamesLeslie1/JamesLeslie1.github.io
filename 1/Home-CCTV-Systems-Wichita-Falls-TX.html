<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you intend to store and how long you plan to keep taped video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to consume storage area rapidly.

On the other hand, if running wires isn't reasonable, you'll enjoy the adaptability that Wi-Fi and wireless cameras use. All these factors to consider will affect what system you ultimately pick. For instance, if you need to capture high-definition surveillance video over extended periods, bandwidth is a factor to consider.</p>
