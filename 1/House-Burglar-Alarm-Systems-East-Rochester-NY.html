In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually by means of 110VAC power.</p>
