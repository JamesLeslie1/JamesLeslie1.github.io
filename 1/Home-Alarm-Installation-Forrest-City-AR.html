Typically, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is a lot of available light, and when the lighting ends up being low or absent (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show. Due to the fact that they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality elements that can adapt and catch exceptional low light video, commercial cameras exceed their more affordable cousins.</p>
