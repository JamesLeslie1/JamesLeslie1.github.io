As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
