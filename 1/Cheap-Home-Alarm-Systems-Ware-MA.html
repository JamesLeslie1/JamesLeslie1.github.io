<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the duty of the entire neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to store and for how long you prepare to keep taped video footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area quickly.
