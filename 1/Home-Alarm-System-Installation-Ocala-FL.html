<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less burglaries throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to cops ability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers fund cops action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and inefficient  approach to burglary reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
