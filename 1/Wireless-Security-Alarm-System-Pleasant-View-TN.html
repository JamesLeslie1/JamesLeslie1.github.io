<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
