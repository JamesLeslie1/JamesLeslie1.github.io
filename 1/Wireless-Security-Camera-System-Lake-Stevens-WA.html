<h3>Home Security Systems in Washington</h3>
<p>Since it's more complicated than it should be, we do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
