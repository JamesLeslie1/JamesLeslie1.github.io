<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. While burglar alarm technology has developed considerably considering that the 19th century, it is still based upon the basic principles innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell. All major alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, utilize distance sensing units in the doors and windows as the first line of defense against prospective intruders, and alarm transfer info to a central monitoring station that can dispatch police rapidly and successfully.</p>
<p>While not a vital requirement for a home security system, all top companies provide a variety of camera choices as add-ons.
