<p>Pelco provides video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, centers, and hotels. IP cameras work by using an IP (IP means web procedure) network, typically the very same data network the rest of a company uses. If bandwidth is a problem, a separate network utilizing category 5 wiring can be utilized. In either case, video information is tape-recorded on a server, which implies video data can be found on website or in a remote location. After testing, we sent out each of our top picks, in addition to the Wyze Web cam v2, to Bill McKinley, head of information security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack screening.
