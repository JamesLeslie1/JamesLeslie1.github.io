This unit is what communicates with all of the security sensors and smart-home elements in your house.

Here's a look at Vivint security cameras for indoor and outdoor surveillance. Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month cheaper and stayed in business three decades so I'm comfy giving them a shot. When my dealership folded, Wish I had looked previously but frankly didnt realize I might conserve cash up until forced to look.</p>
