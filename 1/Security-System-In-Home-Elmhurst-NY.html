For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment by doing this to make consumers stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies means numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers.
