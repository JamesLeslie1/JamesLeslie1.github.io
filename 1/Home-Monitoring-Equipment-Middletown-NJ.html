Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, extra sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you don't commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
