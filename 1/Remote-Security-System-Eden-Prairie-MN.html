<p>Another way to save recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR). Such a device is similar in functionality to a PC with a capture card and suitable video recording software application Unlike PCs, a lot of DVRs created for CCTV functions are ingrained gadgets that need less maintenance and easier setup than a PC-based solution, for a medium to a a great deal of analogue cameras.
