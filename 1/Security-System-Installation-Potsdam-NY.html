After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers complimentary advantages like person detection, familiar-face alerts, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 each month.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked only about 50 percent of the camera and the time regularly disconnected from the network numerous times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine).
