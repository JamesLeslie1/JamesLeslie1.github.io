Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
