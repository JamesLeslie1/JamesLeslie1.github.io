We need to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.

Guidelines such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
