However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to police capability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops response to alarmed properties) a inefficient and pricey method to break-in decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
