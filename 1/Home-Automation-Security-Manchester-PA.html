<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
