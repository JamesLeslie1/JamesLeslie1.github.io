<p>Our security panels are user-friendly, simple to personalize and extremely trusted. And integrated Wi-Fi makes it simple to synch with the ADT mobile app. Dependability. The primary claim to fame that wired security companies have is that the systems can be more dependable than a wireless system.

<p>Video and image feeds have actually shown invaluable for surveillance - however there's space for more functionality by utilizing audio.
