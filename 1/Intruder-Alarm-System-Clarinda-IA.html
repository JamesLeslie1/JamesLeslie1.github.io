<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats because this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest offender for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit restricted to advise as a top pick.</p>
<p>For smart home features, we advise the ADT Pulse package. It delivers full IFTTT (If This Then That) technology to let you from another location arm and disarm your system, turn lights and other electronic devices on and off, and manage the thermostat so you never need to come home to a cold house.

Due to the fact that it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Regrettably I bought 4 cameras that look much like these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Boy was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is really fantastic. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
