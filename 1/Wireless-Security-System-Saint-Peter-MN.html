<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
