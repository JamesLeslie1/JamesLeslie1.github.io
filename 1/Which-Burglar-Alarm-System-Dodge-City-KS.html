<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
