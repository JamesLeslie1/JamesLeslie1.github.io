While improvements in the last few years have made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own special wireless technology, which can't be hindered by other signals), issues persist over vulnerabilities that do not impact hardwired systems.</p>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would notify users when it detected any kind of interference. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would require to be an ideal storm of situations for somebody to successfully hack the system.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
