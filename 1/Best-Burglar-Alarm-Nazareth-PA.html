<p>ADT licensed provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, however the brand doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it states is worth $1,300. The equipment's all supplied by 3rd parties, so what you get may be from a different producer than the equipment your next-door neighbor received. Why's that? ADT uses an independent supplier design including third-party dealers. The dealerships identify which equipment to use. Costs for systems vary. Larger systems that use full-house protection with expert monitoring are the most pricey alternatives. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most economical option.</p>
<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is an extremely common type of two piece sensing unit that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either usually open or typically closed when under the impact of a magnetic field as in the case of distance to the second piece which includes a magnet.

This action combined with an electrical present (normally at 12V DC) allows an alarm control board to spot a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensors are very typical and are found either wired straight to an alarm control board, or they can normally be discovered in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
