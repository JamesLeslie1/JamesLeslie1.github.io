<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and a phenomenal value. It gets an Exceptional score for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription prepare for extra cloud storage. However the company does use a Total Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is found. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>This awesome wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. Throughout testing, we discovered it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly triggering when motion was detected. We enjoy that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive.
