<p>Nearly all wireless home security systems use a cellular connection; therefore, if your internet goes down or your power goes out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that use a web connection as their primary communication source. The majority of internet linked security systems include a battery backup, which indicates if the power goes out your alarm will still work for a restricted quantity of time. But, if your internet goes down, regrettably, you will be without an alarm until it comes back up.</p>

<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, since it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
