<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems intended to summon police department workers, needs registration, evaluation of costs for excessive incorrect burglar alarms, provides procedures for repeat transgressors, and offers an effective date. Whether you're using a wireless IP-based system or sign up for a security component as a part of a "smart home" plan; these innovations depend on user passwords to equip and deactivate them.
