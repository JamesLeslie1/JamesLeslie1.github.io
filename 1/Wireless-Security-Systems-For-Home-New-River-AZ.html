<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top areas. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were often missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline.

Although our testing shouldn't be taken as definitive, our company believe this issue is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the current system.</p>
