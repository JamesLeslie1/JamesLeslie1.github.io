<p>3 big advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, portability and expandability. Occupants, unlike property owners, generally avoid making permanent modifications to their homes.

Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can easily be set up at various homes in the future, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also enable push-button control of the system and general home automation.
