<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you require extra cable televisions. DVR systems are challenging to scale up because once every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you require to purchase a completely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the connected cameras remain in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensors, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most extreme frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
