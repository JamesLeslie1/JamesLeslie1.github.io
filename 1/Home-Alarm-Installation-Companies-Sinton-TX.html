<p>When there is some kind of disruption in the signal, Video fragmentation takes place.

If wireless cameras are not an alternative, a fast speed test will help you identify.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
