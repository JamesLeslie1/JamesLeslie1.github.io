<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a should for use when you're away from home, but you shouldn't need to fumble with your phone when you're coming and going. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it simple to arm and deactivate the system. Including Ring Alarm makes sense if you already own a Ring video doorbell and desire to broaden your home security coverage.

Once a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
