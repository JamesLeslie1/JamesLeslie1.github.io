<p>It depends upon the size and design of the monitoring and the home objectives. The advantages of cameras are that you can get visual verification of any activity occurring inside or outside the home.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
